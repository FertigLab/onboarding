Elana’s lab is supported entirely by grants, and funding for trainee positions depends upon this funding. Lab members will be expected to work to the aims of these grants and include all appropriate grant numbers in publications. Lab members positions will be secured for a time period agreed upon with Elana. They will be encouraged to pursue funding opportunities appropriate to their stage of training, and Elana will provide training in such grant writing. Continuation of positions depends upon HR procedures, which are independent of securing such funding. Elana will be responsible for communicating any funding shortfalls to lab members in a timely manner to ensure that they can find a new position in the appropriate time frame to ensure career development.
