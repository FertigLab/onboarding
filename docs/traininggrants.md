The Fertig lab commits to funding any trainees hired into the lab. Students and postdocs are encouraged to submit training grants to formulate their projects and gain experience for future career development. Elana will help in providing feedback, writing, and editing any grants provided to her in the deadlines established collaboratively. Any grants written within the lab are lab property, and successful grants will be shared with lab members in a common OneDrive folder to provide samples to support training in grant writing. These are to be treated as confidential materials by all lab members.
