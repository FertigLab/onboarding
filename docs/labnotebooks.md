Computational lab members are expected to maintain their code on GitHub to maintain a record. All lab members working in the wet lab are expected to maintain a traditional lab notebook, in keeping with the procedures of the PI of that lab. These notebooks will be property of either the PI running that lab or Elana depending on the project.
