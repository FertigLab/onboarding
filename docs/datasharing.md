As a dry lab, we rely heavily on open data for many of our research projects. Any datasets curated by a lab member should be described in the manifest on google sheets (link on pinned on #groupdata channel of Slack) and saved in the common cloud box described in the channel. The manifest must clearly describe the original source of the data, include a link to the preprocessing script on the private lab GitHub repo CuratedData, and the name of the individual responsible for curating this dataset. This resource may include internally generated data, in which case the lab member should include the PI who generated the data and a description of where to obtain the raw data from. Upon submission of publication, these internal data will be submitted to GEO/SRA/dbGAP in a private repository which will be made public at the time of manuscript acceptance.
