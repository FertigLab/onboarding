Elanaâ€™s lab supports practices to facilitate reproducible research. Code for all data analyses will be maintained and submitted to GitHub, Sourceforge, or as supplemental documents upon publication. New algorithms will be developed and deposited to R/Bioconductor packages or similar. Lab members are to submit intermediate codes to private GitHub repositories in FertigLab shared with Elana, and follow stated lab protocols for branching in developing extensions to current lab software.  Lab members are also encouraged to follow good coding practices, including commenting of code, readable variable names, etc. I encourage trainees to share emerging protocols for coding and reproducible research with the entire group. Genomics studies of clinical data will undergo mandatory, independent code review prior to submission for publication.
