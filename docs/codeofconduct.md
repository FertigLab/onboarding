All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with this code of conduct. We will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, neurodiversity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Elana Fertig immediately. If Elana is the cause of your concern, Leslie Cope <a href = "mailto: lcope1@jhmi.edu">(lcope1@jhmi.edu)</a> is a good informal point of contact; he is Elanaâ€™s direct supervisor. For further information on Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine official policy see here: <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/human_resources/workforce_diversity/equal_opportunity/workplace_harassment.html" target="_blank">hopkinsmedicine.org/human_resources/workforce_diversity/equal_opportunity/workplace_harassment.html</a>


We expect members to follow these guidelines in all in person, phone, online communication, lab-related events, university events, conferences, etc.
