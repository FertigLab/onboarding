## Slack

We use Slack (FertigLab) for rapid communication within the lab. If you’d send an email to someone within the lab, try a Slack message instead. This helps to keep communications in one place, and Elana commits to respond to Slacks (not necessarily immediately, but the same guarantee is not made for email or text). 

## Email and Texting

Elana monitors her email <a href = "mailto:ejfertig@jhmi.edu">(ejfertig@jhmi.edu)</a>, but many communications may be lost due to the extensive and relentless inbox. Lab members are encouraged instead to use Slack communications, and either use the email app within Slack to send emails there or use snippets. Lab members may also text Elana (301-801-0138), but are encouraged to do so only in cases where immediate communication is necessary.

## Social Media

Lab members are encouraged to communicate about their research through public social media, such as Twitter. If you choose to do so then you are expected to follow our code of conduct in any accounts that reflect your professional persona. Please note Elana maintains a professional <a href="https://twitter.com/FertigLab" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and personal <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lanilonzo" target="_blank">Facebook</a> account. Elana will follow or friend lab members on either account, but only if a request is initiated by the trainee. Lab members who do so will be tagged in Elana’s social media promotion of their co-authored work.

## Accounts

Lab members are expected to have accounts and utilize the following resources: 

- Slack (FertigLab)
- Dropbox
- GitHub
- Marcc computing cluster
