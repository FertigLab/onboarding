It is Elanaâ€™s responsibility to make sure you have all supplies and computing resources necessary to complete your project. All postdocs will be provided with a laptop upon starting in the lab, and other trainees will be provided with a desktop in the lab. All trainees will be able to access computing clusters and other lab resources. Please contact Elana immediately if you need any additional supplies to ensure your success.
