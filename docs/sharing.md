We expect all research data to be shared upon publication. 

Unpublished lab materials, including but not limited to software, data, manuscript drafts, lab notebooks and grants are lab property. 

Software and code under construction will be managed on a private repository in [FertigLab GitHub](https://github.com/FertigLab), and released at the time of publication. These materials may not be presented or shared with anyone outside the lab without Elanaâ€™s consent and consent of all other collaborating PIs on the project. This expectation of confidentiality extends to co-mentored students who attend the Fertig lab meetings.

As analysis scripts mature, and others may benefit from using functionality that those scripts provide, scripts and methods may be published as software packages. Following are the preferred repositories for packaging mature code:
* R [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/)
* Python [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), 
* julia [General Registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General)

Personal data such as individual DNA and RNA sequences needs IRB approval to be shared outside of University, and is shared through [dbGAP/SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/docs/submissionguide/). Gene expression de-identified data is shared through [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Arbitrary data and code can be shared via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a platform hosted by CERN that provides `doi` numbers for data and code resources.
